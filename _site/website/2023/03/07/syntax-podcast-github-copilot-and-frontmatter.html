<h2 id="syntax-podcast">Syntax podcast</h2>

<p>In 2023 Syntax.fm has started to bring quite a lot of relevant content. Some of the topics are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://syntax.fm/show/582/ai-and-coding-with-chatgpt">AI and Coding with ChatGPT</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://syntax.fm/show/581/clean-vs-sloppy-code">Clean vs Sloppy Code</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://syntax.fm/show/578/logging">Logging</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="github-copilot">Github Copilot</h2>

<p>I have used now for 6 months and writing md files like the list of podcasts above was so easy. In writing this article alone it was great in assisting with things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sentence completion</li>
  <li>Creating links and in Syntax podcast section it produced the links for me as I was typing the names of podcasts from my phone.</li>
  <li>Sometime it was over eager and I had to delete the whole sentence and start again. But it was still better than typing it all myself.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="front-matter-extension">Front matter extension</h2>

<p>So I created a vscode profile called contentwriting and added frontmatter extension to it (this was recommended by JamesQ Quick in his recent video on youtube). I have also added a few other extensions like conventional commits and markdownlint. Impressed with Frontmatter dashboard and managed to write this article using that.</p>
