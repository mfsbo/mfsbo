# About

I am on Stackoverflow for more than a decade now as [user](https://stackoverflow.com/users/923695/farrukh-subhani). I spend most of time on Github under [`mfsbo`](https://github.com/mfsbo/) however I also contribute under [`farrukhsubhani`](https://github.com/farrukhsubhani) and [`farrukhcw`](https://github.com/farrukhcw)

I started Coding back in 1994 with QBasic and then moved to Web with Macromedia Dreamweaver, Flash for animations and Microsoft Frontpage for serious web development. I started using SVN as version control and got impressed with SourceForge and then Github. I have been using Git since 2008 and Github since 2010.
