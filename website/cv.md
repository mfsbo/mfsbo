    content: Principal Engineer / Engineering Manager focused CV summary for Farrukh Subhani – platform modernization, architecture, cloud, and team enablement.
---

## Overview

> Strategic modernisation, architecture stewardship, platform reliability, and engineering enablement across cloud-native .NET and JavaScript ecosystems.

## Snapshot

- 20+ years delivering and modernising distributed and legacy-backed platforms
- Architectural refactors (WebForms / legacy PHP → .NET Core APIs + Vue/TypeScript)
- Hands-on + strategic: code, design reviews, roadmap alignment, capability building
- Cloud & delivery: Azure, AWS, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), incremental modernization strategies
- Leadership: mentoring (2–35 dev teams), developer experience uplift, process pragmatism
- Publication background (image processing research) blending analytical rigor with delivery pragmatism

## Core Value Themes

| Theme | Focus |
| ----- | ----- |
| Modernisation | Modularisation, API-first, progressive refactor seams |
| Architecture | Layered design, service boundaries, OpenAPI clarity, maintainability |
| Delivery | CI/CD reliability, build automation, environment parity |
| Leadership | Mentorship frameworks, technical strategy translation, enablement |
| Frontend Evolution | Vue/TypeScript migration, component systems, Storybook adoption |
| Observability | Telemetry baselines, structured logging readiness |

## Principal / EM Positioning

- Enable platform scalability by reducing hidden coupling and clarifying integration contracts.
- Raise engineering leverage: codify decisions (ADRs), strengthen review culture, remove toil.
- Align refactor work with product throughput (parallel track decomposition, thin-slice risk mitigation).
- Mentor through architectural intention—not just code critique.
- Advocate measurable small improvements over speculative rewrites.

## Recent Modernisation Arc (Condensed)

| Phase | Before | After / Direction |
| ----- | ------ | ----------------- |
| UI & Delivery | WebForms + jQuery | Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite, modular front-end layers |
| Backend | .NET Framework / PHP mix | .NET Core (6→9 path) + API-first layering |
| Deployments | Manual multi-day windows | CI/CD, <1 day platform cycles, minutes for FE |
| Source Control | Fragmented / absent | Unified GitHub workflows + branching standards |
| Architecture | Postback & page logic | Clear separation: API, domain, integration layers |
| Review & Quality | Ad-hoc | Structured code review guidelines + onboarding docs |

## Selected Leadership Contributions

- Introduced Storybook-driven component workflow improving UI consistency & reusability.
- Built lightweight architecture documentation sets (diagrams + ADR stubs) reducing onboarding time.
- Established telemetry starting points (naming, log shape conventions).
- Guided phased replacement of legacy segments without halting feature delivery.
