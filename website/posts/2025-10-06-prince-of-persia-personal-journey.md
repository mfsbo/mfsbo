# Prince of Persia & Me — Disks, Daggers and Decades of Wall-Running Joy

**Short version:** I first met the Prince in **1993** on a beige PC that wheezed like a desert bellows. Since then I’ve owned (or played within months of release) almost every major incarnation: floppies (5.25" B: then 1.44MB A:), the ambitious-but-wonky 3D era, the silky **Sands of Time** trilogy, the painterly 2008 reboot, the elemental return of **The Forgotten Sands**, VR puzzling with **The Dagger of Time**, up to today’s stylish modern revivals. This is a *player’s travel diary* — light, fun, a little dusty with nostalgia.

## 1. 1993: Rotoscoped Awe on Floppies

My origin story actually starts *after* the original 1989 release: **1993**, a hand‑me‑down PC, and two drives: **B: 5.25"** and **A: 1.44MB**. Installing felt like a mini‑puzzle: *Insert Disk 1… now Disk 2…* . Me and my brother had to figure out some guessed words on page numbers given on screen to get to start the game. Keeping those floppies clean and bend-less was our highest priority.

What hooked me? The *movement*. The rotoscoped animation (Mechner famously used his brother as the model) made the Prince feel *deliberate*. Jumps weren’t floaty; they were timed like small theatre stunts. Spikes? Brutal. The best thing was to hear the background music and we used to listen to it with our 14 inch and later 17 inch CRT monitors off, speakers on and while one of us is doing work the other one takes turn to end a level we are stuck on. We had only 16 colours but the thrill was continuous.

**Why it mattered:** It taught me that *feel* beats raw polygon count. Precision + animation = immersion.

## 2. Shadow & the Flame → Expanding the Myth

Owning **Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame** felt like getting a director’s cut. Bigger vistas, nastier traps, more story flair. The challenge curve sharpened; my patience (and save-scumming) grew with it. The music was still soul capturing. These early games rewarded pattern learning — proto‑soulslike persistence, minus the dodge roll.

## 3. 1999’s 3D Leap (Prince of Persia 3D) — Ambition vs Reality

Then along came **Prince of Persia 3D**. I *wanted* to love it. True 3D! Swashbuckling potential! What I got: camera wrestling, control molasses, and bugs that turned noble leaps into face‑plants. Still, I remember the *feeling* of a beloved 2D space daring to rotate. It’s a lesson: technological transition years are awkward teenagers — goofy, experimental, vital. This was the time I was learning about 3D Studio Max, Maya and what not. Upgraded to 20GB hard drive and CD-ROM and DVD Era. I played less but in these years but focused more on how game developers think and compare it with Need for speed, Fifa, Paranoid, Black and White and few other games of that time.

## 4. 2003: The Sands of Time — Instant Classic Status

Enter *grace*. **Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2003)** is where I truly fell back in love. I bought it within months of release and finished it with that rare *"I could restart immediately"* energy. With so many torrents and high quality DVD download this era was truly web based. I moved to UK and started playing it on a wide monitors with better sound quality.

**Why it sung:**

- **Rewind mechanic**: Friendly to failure; experimentation *invited*.
- **Parkour flow**: Wall‑runs, vaults, poles — a graceful grammar of movement.
- **Tone & narration**: Storybook framing, witty asides (“No, wait, that’s not how it happened…” after a death) — diegetic checkpoints before it was trendy.
- **Puzzle rhythm**: Combat → traversal → spatial riddle — repeat without fatigue.

It aged better than many contemporaries because it married mechanics to *fantasy*: the dagger isn’t a gimmick; it *defines* pacing.

## 5. Warrior Within & The Two Thrones — Edgy Pivot, Then Balance

**Warrior Within (2004)** showed up in black eyeliner blasting metal riffs. I played it close to launch, puzzled but intrigued. The combat depth improved; the tonal shift — less whimsical, more brooding — spent less time on this to be honest.

**The Two Thrones (2005)** corrected course: a hybrid of the first game’s warmth and the sequel’s aggression. The stealth “speed kills” were my quiet obsession: elegantly compressing combat into timed inputs.

## 6. 2008 Reboot — Painterly Detour

The cel‑shaded **2008 Prince of Persia** (I grabbed it early) was like stepping into a moving illustration. Elika’s constant companionship + fail‑state softening (she auto‑rescues you) modernised the Sands rewind ethos into seamless co‑op with an AI.

Some players felt it lacked bite; I appreciated the meditative traversal loops. It’s a comfort game to revisit — like a graphic novel you reread for the mood.

## 7. The Forgotten Sands (2010) — Elemental Flair & Timeline Stitching

**The Forgotten Sands** arrived as a sort of bridge, slotting between earlier narrative beats. I played the Xbox version months inside its release window and enjoyed the elemental powers layering onto traversal (freezing water mid‑flow = chef’s kiss). It didn’t eclipse 2003, but it reaffirmed the *core grammar*: environment + timing + forgiving-but-not-trivial retries.

## 8. Side Currents: Mobile, Classics & VR Escape

Between major beats I dabbled in **Classic** remakes and mobile riffs — fun palette cleansers that reminded me how tight the original design loop was.

Then came **The Dagger of Time (2020)** — a VR escape-room style experience. It translated the series’ signature temporal play into collaborative puzzle solving. I didn’t *rewind* out of a missed jump; I negotiated space and time with teammates. It felt like a respectful spin-off — the DNA expressed through a different genre lens.

## 9. Modern Renaissance: Lost Crown, Rogue Experiments & (Future) Remake

Recent years rekindled momentum: stylish **side-scrolling precision**, roguelike spins, and the long‑gestating *Sands of Time* remake simmering toward (hopefully) a polished 2026 arrival. The franchise now feels like a *toolbox of verbs* (run, wall, vault, rewind, freeze, cooperate) ready to be rearranged for new genres.

## 13. Closing Thought

From dusty floppies to VR puzzles, *Prince of Persia* has been a quiet constant — teaching me that *feel*, *flow* and *forgiveness* outlast graphical fashion. Every wall-run is still a tiny leap of faith — and somehow, after three decades, I’m still grinning when the Prince sticks the landing.
