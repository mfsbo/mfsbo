## Syntax podcast

In 2023 Syntax.fm has started to bring quite a lot of relevant content. Some of the topics are:
- [AI and Coding with ChatGPT](https://syntax.fm/show/582/ai-and-coding-with-chatgpt)
- [Clean vs Sloppy Code](https://syntax.fm/show/581/clean-vs-sloppy-code)
- [Logging](https://syntax.fm/show/578/logging)

## Github Copilot

I have used now for 6 months and writing md files like the list of podcasts above was so easy. In writing this article alone it was great in assisting with things like:
- Sentence completion
- Creating links and in Syntax podcast section it produced the links for me as I was typing the names of podcasts from my phone.
- Sometime it was over eager and I had to delete the whole sentence and start again. But it was still better than typing it all myself.

## Front matter extension

So I created a vscode profile called contentwriting and added frontmatter extension to it (this was recommended by JamesQ Quick in his recent video on youtube). I have also added a few other extensions like conventional commits and markdownlint. Impressed with Frontmatter dashboard and managed to write this article using that.
