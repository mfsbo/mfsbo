> Senior Software Engineer & Technical Lead – Cloud-native modernisation, .NET, JavaScript ecosystems, architectural refactoring, API platforms, and engineering enablement.

## Executive Summary

I am a hands-on senior engineer and technical lead with 20+ years delivering modern, scalable, and maintainable software across cloud, web, and platform domains. I specialise in:

- Modernising legacy monoliths into modular/service-based platforms
- Designing and evolving API-first backends (.NET, REST, OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Establishing sustainable engineering practices (CI/CD, code quality, documentation, dev environment maturity)
- Guiding teams through platform transitions (technology migrations, process adoption, tooling upgrades)
- Balancing architectural vision with incremental, low-risk delivery

I operate comfortably across architecture, implementation, mentoring, and pragmatic process leadership—particularly in environments where systems need stabilisation, scale, or re-alignment with product goals.

### Principal Engineer / Engineering Manager Focus

When operating in a Principal Engineer or Engineering Manager capacity, I emphasise:

- Technical Strategy: Aligning architectural direction with product and commercial objectives; defining guardrails not gatekeeping.
- Architectural Stewardship: Evaluating build vs integrate; identifying refactor seams; enabling progressive modernization instead of disruptive rewrites.
- Engineering Effectiveness: Leveling up code review practices, build/test automation maturity, developer environment ergonomics, and clear contribution guidelines.
- Reliability & Operability: Observability baselines (logging consistency, lightweight telemetry adoption) to shorten diagnosis cycles.
- Talent Growth: Structured mentorship (pairing patterns, architectural walkthroughs, decision record coaching) and encouraging ownership.
- Cross-Functional Translation: Converting executive goals (speed, stability, cost) into actionable engineering initiatives and measurable outcomes.

Leadership differentiators:

- Able to stabilise and *unfreeze* legacy codebases before guiding refactor tracks.
- Pragmatic: avoids speculative abstraction; values data-backed iteration.
- Creates documentation ecosystems (architecture notes, ADRs, onboarding primers) that survive turnover.
- Bridges hands-on depth with strategic clarity—operates comfortably at design review or implementation trench.

## Leadership & Impact Highlights

- Led multi-year platform refactors replacing legacy WebForms / vanilla PHP with .NET Core APIs + modern Vue/TypeScript UIs.
- Introduced structured component systems (Storybook + atomic design) to improve reuse, visual consistency, and onboarding.
- Set up secure CI/CD workflows (GitHub-based) covering web, API, and mobile deliverables; reduced deployment friction and increased reliability.
- Designed and rolled out backend API layers with OpenAPI documentation enabling clearer integration boundaries.
- Mentored cross-functional teams (2–35 engineers) on architecture thinking, Git workflows (incl. conventional commits), and delivery discipline.
- Guided transitions from undocumented codebases into documented, testable, and observable systems (telemetry + structured logs).
- Supported organisational change in both enterprise-scale (Countrywide) and lean growth-stage contexts (Booking Online Ltd & bespoke consulting).

## Selected Project & Modernisation Narrative

In 2018–2019, led strategic evolution planning moving from pre-modernized patterns to a modern, modular application stack:

Before (2018):

- WebForms + jQuery
- MSSQL + .NET Framework
- Manual, high-friction deployments (multi-day windows)
- No unified source control processes
- Postback-heavy UI & legacy patterns

After (2025 trajectory):

- Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite
- .NET Core (6→9) + adoption of .NET Aspire principles
- CI/CD enabling full-stack deploy cycles < 1 day (front-end minutes; platform < 6 hours)
- GitHub-based repository strategy & automated workflows
- API-first layering & clearer module boundaries
- AI-augmented PR reviews / assistive tooling

Outcomes:

- Improved delivery cadence and onboarding speed
- Higher confidence in release quality & rollback safety
- Clearer separation of concerns (front-end vs domain services vs integration)
