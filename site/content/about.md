# About

I am on Stackoverflow for more than a decade now as [user](https://stackoverflow.com/users/923695/farrukh-subhani). I spend most of time on Github under [`mfsbo`](https://github.com/mfsbo/) however I also contribute under [`farrukhsubhani`](https://github.com/farrukhsubhani) and [`farrukhcw`](https://github.com/farrukhcw)

I started Coding back in 1994 with QBasic and then moved to Web with Macromedia Dreamweaver, Flash for animations and Microsoft Frontpage for serious web development. I started using SVN as version control and got impressed with SourceForge and then Github. I have been using Git since 2008 and Github since 2010.

I started using html, css and javascript back in 2001 and mostly using it for personal projects hosted on TuCows and FortuneCity. I moved to Server side coding soon in 2003 and since then I have been back and forth between Frontend and Backend.

I started with PHP, MySQL but had my toe dipped in MSSQL, Oracle, C++, C#. I used to teach computer graphics and Java back in 2004/5 to University Students. With Javascript being used on mobile and web I started to invest my time into jQuery plugins, Knockout, SignalR and AngularJS. I managed to launch some big projects with Laravel using MVC, Migrations and Lumen for APIs. Frontend for these projects was mostly Knockout or AngularJS but no Typescript. Most of my PHP work was on Linux machines so I had to handle infra upgrades, automate deployments and manage servers. I was also involved in C# MVC hosted on Windows IIS where I did few projects for APIs with Angular, jQuery and React as frontend.

In 2015 I started working with Typescript for developing mobile apps with Adobe Phonegap and Cordova. I did few projects with Ionic and Angular 2. I then shift to React and Vue as Ionic supported all of these. For backend I have worked on dotnet core 2.1, 6,7 and 8.

I have worked in retail, risk management, banking, ecommerce, healthcare, property management, education and entertainment industries. Nearly 70% of my work has been migrating legacy systems to modern architecture and rest of 30% is buidling new systems from scratch. I have enjoyed working with teams of 2 to 35 people, working in different time zonnes, managing remote teams and working with clients directly.

With AI coming into equation I have worked with OpenAI API for generative text and images and have done projects where GPT-3 and GPT-4.5 can be swapped to see difference in cost and quality of generated content. I collect a lot of data from Google Analytics that I have sampled for vector databases and training for niche industries.

I started to use Azure and AWS from 2014 and have deployed, managed and scaled applications on both platforms. I started using Github Actions to deploy via FTP, Docker and Static Sites. I use Powershell, Github CLI, Azure CLI and AWS CLI for automation and deployments.
